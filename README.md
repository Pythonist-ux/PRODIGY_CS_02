# Image Encryption Tool

## Functionality:
This application allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using simple pixel manipulation techniques. It provides a user-friendly interface to select an image, encrypt it, decrypt it, and download the encrypted or decrypted image.

## Features:
- **Select an image:** Users can choose an image file from their computer.
- **Encrypt Image:** Encrypts the selected image using a simple pixel manipulation algorithm.
- **Decrypt Image:** Decrypts the encrypted image back to its original form.
- **Download Image:** Saves the encrypted or decrypted image to the user's computer.

## How to Use:
1. **Select Image:**
   - Click the "Select Image" button to choose an image file from your computer.

## Additional Information:
- The application uses a simple pixel manipulation algorithm to encrypt and decrypt images.
- The encryption and decryption process is irreversible, meaning that once an image is encrypted, it cannot be decrypted without the original encryption key.
